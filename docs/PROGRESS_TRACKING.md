| Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)       | `In Progress` | A foundational system exists distinguishing `platform` and `company` roles. UI elements are conditionally rendered. Specific roles (Admin, Project Manager, etc.) and granular permissions are not yet fully implemented.                                                                                                                |
| Session Management                     | `In Progress` | Automatic inactivity timeout with a warning dialog is fully implemented (`useInactivityTimeout`).

| Guided Registration Flow               | `Completed`   | A multi-step sign-up form (`MultiStepSignupForm.tsx`) guides new companies through registration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Email Verification                     | `Not Started` | Firebase Auth's email verification flow needs to be triggered and the UI needs to handle unverified states.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Profile Setup Wizard                   | `In Progress` | A comprehensive user profile page (`/profile`) exists, but it's not currently part of a guided post-registration wizard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Welcome Dashboard                      | `In Progress` | Basic dashboards exist for both `platform` and `company` roles, but they lack guided "getting started" content.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Onboarding via Invitation              | `Completed`   | The entire flow for inviting, registering, and activating a user via a unique token is complete.
