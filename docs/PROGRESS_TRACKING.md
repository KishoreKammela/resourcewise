| **1.1 Multi-Role Auth & Auth**            |               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Firebase Authentication                   | `Completed`   | Secure email/password login and registration is implemented. Token handling is managed by the Firebase SDK.                                                                                                                                         |
| Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)         | `Not Started` | Backend and UI for SMS/email 2FA setup and verification needs to be built.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)          | `In Progress` | A foundational system exists distinguishing `platform` and `company` roles. UI elements are conditionally rendered. Specific roles (Admin, Project Manager, etc.) and granular permissions are not yet fully implemented.                               |
| Session Management                        | `In Progress` | `onAuthStateChanged` manages basic sessions. Automatic timeout and concurrent session limits are not implemented.                                                                                                                                    |
| Password Security                         | `Completed`   | Uses Firebase Auth's built-in hashing. Password policy component (`PasswordPolicy.tsx`) enforces complexity on the client-side during signup and password changes.                                                                                     |
| Audit Logging                             | `Completed`   | The `createAuditLog` service is implemented and used across all authentication and user management actions (`authActions.ts`, `userActions.ts`, etc.) to record events in Firestore.                                                                |
| **1.2 User Registration & Onboarding**    |               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Guided Registration Flow                  | `Completed`   | A multi-step sign-up form (`MultiStepSignupForm.tsx`) guides new companies through registration.                                                                                                                                                      |
| Email Verification                        | `Not Started` | Firebase Auth's email verification flow needs to be triggered and the UI needs to handle unverified states.                                                                                                                                           |
| Profile Setup Wizard                      | `In Progress` | A comprehensive user profile page (`/profile`) exists, but it's not currently part of a guided post-registration wizard.                                                                                                                            |
| Welcome Dashboard                         | `In Progress` | Basic dashboards exist for both `platform` and `company` roles, but they lack guided "getting started" content.                                                                                                                                   |
| Onboarding via Invitation                 | `Completed`   | The entire flow for inviting, registering, and activating a user via a unique token is complete. This covers both platform users and company team members.                                                                                             |

Advanced Resource Profile Mgmt**     |               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Comprehensive Profile System              | `Not Started` | The data model for `Resource` exists in `types.ts`, but the UI and backend services to create and manage them are not yet built.                                                                                                                      |
| Document Management (Resumes)             | `Not Started` | Resume upload functionality needs to be added to the UI, and Firebase Storage needs to be integrated to store the files.                                                                                                                                |
| **3. Sophisticated Skills Management**    |               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| AI Skill Extraction                       | `Not Started` | The Genkit flow `smart-skills-extractor` is a placeholder. It needs to be implemented with a real prompt to the Gemini API to parse resumes. The UI needs to be connected to this flow.                                                              |
| **4. Basic Requirement & Job Mgmt**       | `Not Started` |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **5. Fundamental Matching Algorithm**     | `Not Started` |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **6. Basic Analytics & Reporting**        | `In Progress` | A basic analytics page exists (`/analytics`) with placeholder charts. It needs to be connected to real data from Firestore.                                                                                                                            |
