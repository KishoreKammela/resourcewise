| **1.1 Multi-Role Auth & Auth**         |               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Firebase Authentication                | `Completed`   | Secure email/password login and registration is implemented. Token handling is managed by the Firebase SDK.                                                                                                                                  |
| Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)      | `Not Started` | Backend and UI for SMS/email 2FA setup and verification needs to be built.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)       | `In Progress` | A foundational system exists distinguishing `platform` and `company` roles. UI elements are conditionally rendered. Specific roles (Admin, Project Manager, etc.) and granular permissions are not yet fully implemented.                    |
| Session Management                     | `In Progress` | Automatic inactivity timeout with a warning dialog is fully implemented (`useInactivityTimeout`). The settings are dynamically configurable by platform admins. Concurrent session limits are not yet implemented.                           |
| Password Security                      | `Completed`   | Uses Firebase Auth's built-in hashing. Password policy component (`PasswordPolicy.tsx`) enforces complexity on the client-side during signup and password changes.                                                                           |
| Audit Logging                          | `Completed`   | The `createAuditLog` service is implemented and used across all authentication and user management actions (`authActions.ts`, `userActions.ts`, etc.) to record events in Firestore.                                                         |
| **1.2 User Registration & Onboarding** |               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Guided Registration Flow               | `Completed`   | A multi-step sign-up form (`MultiStepSignupForm.tsx`) guides new companies through registration.                                                                                                                                             |
| Email Verification                     | `Not Started` | Firebase Auth's email verification flow needs to be triggered and the UI needs to handle unverified states.                                                                                                                                  |
| Profile Setup Wizard                   | `In Progress` | A comprehensive user profile page (`/profile`) exists, but it's not currently part of a guided post-registration wizard.                                                                                                                     |
| Welcome Dashboard                      | `In Progress` | Basic dashboards exist for both `platform` and `company` roles, but they lack guided "getting started" content.                                                                                                                              |
| Onboarding via Invitation              | `Completed`   | The entire flow for inviting, registering, and activating a user via a unique token is complete. This covers both platform users and company team members.                                                                                   |
| **2. Advanced Resource Profile Mgmt**  |               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Comprehensive Profile System           | `Completed`   | The `Resource` data model is defined in `types.ts`. The UI (`/resources/add`, `/resources/[id]/edit`) and backend services (`resourceActions.ts`, `resource.services.ts`) to create, read, update, and list resources are fully implemented. |
| Document Management (Resumes)          | `Completed`   | Resume upload functionality has been added to the "Add Resource" and "Edit Resource" forms. The file is not stored but is processed in-memory by the AI flow.                                                                                |
| **3. Sophisticated Skills Management** |               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| AI Skill Extraction                    | `Completed`   | The Genkit flow `smart-skills-extractor` is implemented with a Gemini API prompt to parse resumes and extract both technical and soft skills. This is integrated into the "Add" and "Edit" resource forms.                                   |
| **4. Basic Requirement & Job Mgmt**    | `Not Started` |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **5. Fundamental Matching Algorithm**  | `Not Started` |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **6. Basic Analytics & Reporting**     | `In Progress` | A basic analytics page exists (`/analytics`) with placeholder charts. It needs to be connected to real data from Firestore.                                                                                                                  |
